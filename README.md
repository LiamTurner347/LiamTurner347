## Hello, I'm Liam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend-leaning full-stack engineer with expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and React. I excel at breaking down complex problems systematically and communicating technical concepts with precision, abilities sharpened during my previous career as a lawyer. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and keen to solve increasingly challenging problems.

Away from the computer, you will likely find me:
* Training and/or coaching HYROX
* Exploring the Yorkshire countryside
* Eating the best food (likely Japanese or Mediterranean) wherever I travel

### Frame

I recently developed [Frame](https://www.frame-platform.com/), an image search platform specifically designed for developers. It simplifies the embedding and image search process and deploys directly to a user's AWS account. The platform provides image embedding and multimodal similarity search through a user-friendly API.

You can learn more about Frame [here](https://www.frame-platform.com/case-study/introduction/).
